Companion files to the Kx Technical White Paper [Signal processing and q](http://code.kx.com/q/wp/signal-processing). 

This repo contains functions to

-   Implement a complex framework in q
-   Perform a Radix-2 FFT
-   Perform a simple anomaly detection on timeseries data

The work on a Bluesteinâ€™s z-chirp FFT is still in progress.
